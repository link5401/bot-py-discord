# bot-py-discord
## What does this discord bot do ?
I created this discord bot to browse through an op.gg site to navigate the runes for a champion using BeautifulSoup.

**To see the bot returning images of 1 build: **

>$b champion lane <0-4>

0-4 is 1 of the 4 builds provided by op.gg

**To see all 4 builds in embeded message:
>$c champion lane

## What did i learn through this project:
1. Reading elements of a website.
2. Using APIs is really convinient
