# bot-py-discord
## What does this discord bot do ?
I created this discord bot to do mutiple stuff like:
  1. Scraping op.gg to get desired build then send it to the invoked channel
  2. Getting a randomquote from zen api
  3. Using youtube API v3 to fetch videos from one of my favorite channel
  4. Getting crypto prices with uses of several API calls and data cleaning.


## What did i learn through this project:
1. WebScraping technique
2. Using APIs is really convinient
3. Hardcoding stuff is a very bad practice
